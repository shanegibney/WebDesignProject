Your final project report should be zipped into a folder along with your website code (HTML/CSS files) and uploaded to Moodle on/before the due deadline. Projects submitted after the deadline may incur penalties. NOTE: If your project is too big to upload to Moodle (500mb+), you may also submit using your NCI student OneDrive account.
